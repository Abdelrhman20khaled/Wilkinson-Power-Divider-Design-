# Wilkinson Power Divider Design

This repository contains the schematic and simulation files for a Wilkinson Power Divider designed for microstrip implementation. The project is part of a learning initiative and is being developed using the **Advanced Design System (ADS)** simulator.

## Project Overview

The Wilkinson Power Divider is a passive RF device used to equally split an input signal into two output signals with the same phase and amplitude. Its design ensures isolation between the output ports and provides matched input impedance, making it a key component in RF and microwave systems.

### Features of the Project:
- **Simulation Tool**: Advanced Design System (ADS)
- **Implementation**: Microstrip technology
- **Status**: Work in progress

## Schematic
The Wilkinson Power Divider schematic includes all essential components for power splitting and port isolation, such as inductors, capacitors, and resistors. The design ensures matched impedance at the input and output ports, while maintaining good isolation between the output ports. This schematic is intended for microstrip implementation and is optimized for use with a 50-ohm system.

## Project Goals
1. **Learn and implement** the theory behind Wilkinson Power Dividers.
2. **Simulate and optimize** the performance using ADS.
3. Gain practical experience in microstrip design techniques.

## Current Status
- The project is still under construction.
- Schematic design is being refined for optimal performance.
